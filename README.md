This is a Pacman Game program that we had to create for a school project. I have my original pacman game titled PacGame that I submitted first and my first attempt at a server/client game with the PacGameServer and PacGameClient files. These not only interacted with eachother but also gave me more time to work on bugs and adding in a few extra bits. Be warned, this game is not perfect but it is great in it's own weird way
